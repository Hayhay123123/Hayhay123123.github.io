## My Interests
[I love half life 1](https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4149086-halflife3.jpg)
I like reading, more specifically I like reading stories where the main protagonist is uncouth.
[Joesph Joestar](https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jojo-joseph-joestar.jpg) - He is extremely well written.

[Lloyd Frontera](https://i.namu.wiki/i/UQLcxjq82ue-eZzSZsbHlc3YE2JXwHT0bwCZbyqyOPBB3e-ZTnUMjJU00sdsO_TQSBdL5gbcEUcbR1KYPwYG_H-1lQKI36zdKs-ZuvdVlzdQVoRfm_w4pS3vtBqL4h6ffxEmBw42JWpXvH3YXfSyWg.webp "Lloyd Frontera") - The protagonist of my favorite webnovel to date.
## Websites I Recommend
[Webtoons](https://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-warrior-returns/list?title_no=3265&page=13) - I find weebtoons to be a great place to read and experience well written stories, written by authors for free.
[YouTube](www.youtube.com) - I like to watch videos on documentary style videos on YouTube, its a bastion of information.
